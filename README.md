ArtRestorer AI is an AI-powered web application that provides intelligent guidance for art restoration and cultural heritage preservation. It analyzes artwork damage, considers historical context, and offers ethical conservation recommendations to support informed decision-making.

# About the Project

ArtRestorer AI is an AI-driven web application designed to assist in art restoration and cultural heritage preservation. The platform provides intelligent guidance for analyzing artwork damage, understanding historical context, and recommending responsible conservation approaches.

The application supports various art forms including paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, murals, textiles, and ceramics. It acts as a digital advisory assistant by combining artificial intelligence with principles of art history and ethical conservation.

The tool does not perform physical restoration but offers structured suggestions to help users make informed decisions.
